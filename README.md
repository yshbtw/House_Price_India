# House_Price_India
This project builds a House Price model using a Random Forest Regressor. It predicts house price based on features like bedrooms, bathrooms, floor, and waterfront or other data. The model is trained, evaluated using MAE and RMSE, and predictions are compared with actual sales for accuracy tracking.
